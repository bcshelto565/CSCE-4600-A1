# Project 1: Process Scheduler

## Description 
For this project I built a simple process scheduler that takes in a file containing example processes, and outputs a schedule based on the three different schedule types:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- SJF Priority
- Round-robin (RR)
- Assume that all processes are CPU bound (they do not block for I/O).

There are comments throughout the functions explaining what is happening each line so that it is understandable.
My variables might be weirdly named but this was done to follow my coding flow and is decipherable when following the comments
